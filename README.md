# MAGD-150-Project

The first three projects in my MAGD 150 Class
**SchwartzKLab1** is an image of a moon with craters on it
**SchwartzKLab2** is an image of multiple balloons connected at a single point
**SchwartzKLab3** is a program that draws with the mouse and when clicked shoots a single firework that fades out
